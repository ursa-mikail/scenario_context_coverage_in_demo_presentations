# Scenario Context Coverage in Demo Presentations
## Situation Scenario Scene Case Possibility

We articulate the narrative by initially presenting the situation, which outlines the problem or topic of interest. This is followed by a scenario, providing a concrete example of the situation. Within each scenario, there may be distinct scenes, illustrating specific aspects or events. For each scene, we explore various cases, detailing different possibilities that might arise under specific conditions and circumstances.

### Situation
<b>Situation</b>: Overarching context or issue we are addressing. It sets the stage for understanding the broader environment or problem.
Conditions: These include the background details, existing challenges, and any constraints that define the situation.

### Scenario
<b>Scenario</b>: Detailed example that brings the situation to life. It showcases a particular instance or application of the situation.
Conditions: Scenarios often include specific conditions such as the time, location, key players involved, and any relevant contextual factors.

### Scene
<b>Scene</b>: Within each scenario, scenes break down the action into more manageable parts. Bring the audience to each scene to capture a moment or a segment of the scenario.
Conditions: Scenes are characterized by the immediate circumstances, the interactions taking place, and the progression of events.

### Cases
<b>Cases</b>: Different potential outcomes or variations that could occur within each scene.
Possibilities : Each case is explored through various possibilities, where different variables and conditions lead to different results. Case possibilities get people to consider multiple perspectives and potential consequences, ensuring a comprehensive understanding of the situation.

By structuring the narrative this way, we can thoroughly examine the situation, provide clear examples through scenarios, detail specific moments with scenes, and explore various outcomes with possibilities and cases.
